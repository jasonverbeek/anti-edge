## Anti-Edge 1.0.0

### Installation:

Download the latest release and;

- extract the zip to i.e `C:\Program Files\Anti-Edge_1.0.0\`
- run install_admin.bat as Administrator

Doing this will create the Anti-Edge Service in your windows services list.

This service will sometimes check if msedge.exe is installed on your system and simply remove it

### Run without installing

Download the latest release and;

- Extract the archive somewhere
- Simply run `anti-edge.exe` (**NOT** anti-edge-service.exe) as administrator and it will do a single cleanup job.

Keep in mind that windows will reinstall edge at some point again
